Mixology
========

The Mixology digital media platform provides a simple way to combine multiple live video streams with interactive graphics.  It's built on top of WebRTC, and is a good choice for web apps that will run in the Chrome and/or Firefox browsers.  Mixology was created by [Gearcloud Labs](www.gearcloudlabs.com) in 2014.
